### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD candidate in the Desplan lab at New York University. I study genetic programs that specify different kind of neurons in development. Using fly visual system as my model, Iâ€™m currently studying how early patterning events are translated into the making of different cells using single-cell transcriptomics. While still trying to get a hold of it, I am generally interested in statistics and interpretable machine learning.

Besides the links in my profile, you can also find me on <a rel="me" href="https://drosophila.social/@ycchen_tw">Mastodon</a>.
